# macOS companion tools

RCKangaroo-MT still requires NVIDIA CUDA for the actual solver. Apple Silicon GPUs do not run CUDA kernels, so the `macos/` folder is a companion workflow for preparing target files on a MacBook before running the solver on a CUDA machine.

## Prepare a target list

```sh
python3 macos/prepare_targets.py stripped.txt -o targets.cleaned.txt
```

The script:

- accepts compressed `02...` / `03...` and uncompressed `04...` secp256k1 public keys;
- validates every point against the secp256k1 curve;
- removes blank lines, comment lines, and inline `# comments`;
- writes normalized compressed public keys by default;
- removes duplicate targets unless `--keep-duplicates` is used.

Useful options:

```sh
python3 macos/prepare_targets.py stripped.txt --stats-only
python3 macos/prepare_targets.py stripped.txt -o targets.cleaned.txt --skip-invalid
python3 macos/prepare_targets.py stripped.txt -o targets.uncompressed.txt --uncompressed
```

Then copy `targets.cleaned.txt` to the CUDA host and run:

```sh
./rckangaroo -dp 16 -range 84 -start 1000000000000000000000 -targets targets.cleaned.txt
```

## Notes

The macOS script is intentionally pure Python and uses only the standard library. It does not need Homebrew, CUDA, OpenSSL, or third-party Python packages.

If you want to generate tames, do that on the CUDA host. With multi-target mode, existing tames must already exist; generate them separately before using `-targets`.
