# RCKangaroo-MT Research Log

This file is the compact running record for optimization work. Keep it factual:
what changed, what was measured, what was rejected, and which correctness gate
was used. Do not treat an experiment as an improvement unless the oracle passes
and the metric beats the configured baseline gate.

## Current Ground Rules

- Correctness comes before throughput. Every solver or kernel benchmark must
  report `correctness:true` or a clean `skipped:true` when hardware is not
  visible.
- The default local gate is `make macos-check`.
- CPU kangaroo performance candidates use:
  `python3 autoresearch/runner.py --experiment jacobian_kangaroo_multi16_small --budget-sec 5 --paired-baseline-ref main`.
- Metal candidates must be tested on a real Apple Silicon Metal runtime, not
  only inside the restricted sandbox, because sandboxed runs may report
  `no Metal device available`.
- Merge only `keep` results. Remove or leave isolated any experiment that is
  incorrect, slower than the gate, or only noisy.
- Once a candidate passes all required gates, fast-forward it into `main` and
  push it. The next experiment must branch from that updated `main`, making the
  proven result the new baseline.
- Keep rejected work isolated until its lesson is recorded here or in
  `autoresearch/benchmarks.jsonl`.

## Hardware Reference

The local target machine is a MacBook Air M3 with 16 GB RAM and a 10-core Apple
M3 GPU. Metal is available outside the sandbox. CUDA remains NVIDIA-only; macOS
GPU work should use Metal.

## Accepted Results

### Quality Gates

- Added `docs/QUALITY_GATES.md` and `docs/QUALITY_GATES.it.md`.
- Added `tests/check_quality_gates.sh`.
- Wired quality-gate checks into `make macos-check`.
- The gate now documents target, allowed edits, correctness oracle, performance
  metric, baseline comparison, hidden tests, reproducibility, logging,
  submission, and rollback.

### Metal Benchmark Stabilization

- Metal field benchmarks accept `--min-ms`.
- JSON reports `sample_count`, `min_ms`, total `iterations`, `ops_per_sec`,
  `correctness`, and `skipped`.
- This reduces short-dispatch timing noise and lets CI skip cleanly when Metal
  is not visible.

### Metal Dispatch Size Tuning

Commit: `bbde2c8` (`perf: tune Metal field dispatch size`)

- Changed Metal field dispatches from one execution-width group to a larger
  SIMD-aligned threadgroup, capped at 256 threads.
- Benchmarks now report:
  `threadgroup_limit`, `thread_execution_width`,
  `max_threads_per_threadgroup`, `threads_per_threadgroup`.
- On the local M3 run, Metal reported `thread_execution_width=32`,
  `max_threads_per_threadgroup=1024`, and `threads_per_threadgroup=256`.
- Paired autoresearch against `main`:
  - `metal_field_square`: `120,182,161.633272 ops/sec`, `1.054411x`,
    `status=keep`, `correctness=true`.
  - `metal_field_mul`: `110,169,933.604968 ops/sec`, `1.127512x`,
    `status=keep`, `correctness=true`.
  - A second `metal_field_mul` paired rerun under noisier conditions still kept
    the candidate: `107,181,958.674000 ops/sec`, `1.045700x`,
    `status=keep`, `correctness=true`.

### Fused Square-Mul Field Kernel

Commit: `bbde2c8` (`perf: tune Metal field dispatch size`)

- Added `field_square_mul_mod_p`, computing `(a * a) * b mod p` in one Metal
  dispatch.
- Added CLI commands:
  - `metal-field-square-mul-test`
  - `metal-field-square-mul-bench --iterations N [--min-ms N]`
- Added `autoresearch/experiments/metal_field_square_mul.json`.
- Autoresearch first record:
  - `116,411,049.047869 ops/sec`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `skipped=false`
- Early pre-tuning measurements showed that fusing alone was not automatically
  faster. The useful result is the combination of a real fused oracle plus the
  larger threadgroup dispatch shape.

### Metal Jacobian-Plus-Affine Add Kernel

Commit: `07615a1` (`feat: add Metal Jacobian affine add kernel`)

- Added the first point-level Apple Silicon GPU primitive,
  `jacobian_add_affine`.
- The kernel consumes packed Jacobian `x/y/z` plus an input infinity flag and
  affine `x/y`, then emits packed Jacobian `x/y/z` plus an output infinity flag.
- The self-test and benchmark cover generic additions, `p` infinity, doubling
  (`h=0,r=0`), and point-at-infinity (`h=0,r!=0`) branches.
- Added CLI commands:
  - `metal-jacobian-add-test`
  - `metal-jacobian-add-bench --iterations N [--min-ms N] [--tg-limit N]`
- Added `autoresearch/experiments/metal_jacobian_add.json` with three runner
  samples.
- Local M3 autoresearch result:
  - median `18,987,732.357266 ops/sec`
  - min `16,122,729.006089 ops/sec`
  - max `23,145,877.471189 ops/sec`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Fixed-Step Metal Jacobian Walk Kernel

Commit: `74d6dad` (`feat: add Metal fixed-step Jacobian walk`)

- Added `jacobian_affine_walk_fixed`, a walk-core Metal primitive that keeps one
  Jacobian state inside a GPU thread and applies the same affine mixed-add step
  repeatedly before writing the final state.
- This is not a full kangaroo kernel yet: it intentionally excludes variable
  jump selection, distinguished-point filtering, and collision-table work.
- Added CLI commands:
  - `metal-jacobian-walk-test`
  - `metal-jacobian-walk-bench --iterations N [--steps N] [--min-ms N] [--tg-limit N]`
- Added `autoresearch/experiments/metal_jacobian_walk.json` with three runner
  samples.
- Local M3 autoresearch result with `steps_per_sample=8`:
  - median `43,635,268.698477 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - min `39,216,303.440935 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - max `43,712,057.290467 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Metal Jacobian Jump-Table Walk Kernel

Commit: `2c2c9b5` (`feat: add Metal Jacobian jump-table walk`)

- Added `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table`, a variable-jump walk primitive that
  keeps one Jacobian state inside each Metal thread, reads a deterministic
  per-sample and per-step jump index, selects from an affine jump table, and
  writes the final Jacobian state.
- Added CPU replay oracle for the exact same jump-index sequence, so the
  benchmark verifies correctness rather than only measuring dispatch speed.
- This is still not a full kangaroo kernel: it intentionally excludes
  distinguished-point filtering, scalar-distance accumulation, and
  collision-table writes. Those are the next correctness surfaces.
- Added CLI commands:
  - `metal-jacobian-jump-walk-test`
  - `metal-jacobian-jump-walk-bench --iterations N [--steps N] [--jumps N] [--min-ms N] [--tg-limit N]`
- Added `autoresearch/experiments/metal_jacobian_jump_walk.json` with three
  runner samples.
- Local M3 autoresearch result with `steps_per_sample=8` and `jump_count=16`:
  - median `29,322,230.463689 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - min `24,300,650.024927 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - max `37,278,370.994648 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Direct Metal Jump Indices

Commit: `c41c6d7` (`perf: use direct Metal jump indices`)

- Removed the per-step `% jump_count` from the Metal jump-table walk hot loop.
- Kept correctness strict by validating on the host that every generated
  `jump_indices` entry is already inside the affine jump table before dispatch.
- Updated the Metal source gate so future changes do not accidentally reinsert
  a modulo in the kernel loop.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`:
  - candidate median `38,210,997.361683 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `35,711,313.723010 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.069997x`
  - min `25,910,772.852663 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - max `39,764,446.199153 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Metal Jump-Walk Distance Accumulation

Commit: `1d8455d` (`feat: track Metal jump-walk distances`)

- Added a 64-bit jump-distance table and per-sample distance output to
  `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table`.
- The CPU oracle now verifies both the final Jacobian point and accumulated
  scalar distance for the exact same jump-index sequence.
- Bench JSON includes `distance_tracking=uint64` and `distance_checksum`, so
  future Metal changes cannot silently drop distance state while preserving
  point output.
- This removes one blocker for a full Metal kangaroo loop. Distinguished-point
  filtering and collision-table writes are still intentionally outside this
  kernel.
- Local M3 autoresearch result with `steps_per_sample=8` and `jump_count=16`:
  - median `30,127,453.595735 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - min `24,629,646.294400 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - max `37,741,158.058549 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Metal Projective DP Candidate Flags

Commit: `31c38cf` (`feat: emit Metal jump-walk DP candidates`)

- Added optional `--dp-bits N` to the Metal jump-table walk benchmark.
- The kernel emits one projective distinguished-point candidate flag per final
  walk state using low bits of projective `x[0]`.
- The CPU oracle verifies point, distance, and the exact same projective DP
  predicate. This is intentionally not yet an affine DP key or collision-table
  insert path.
- Bench JSON includes `dp_tracking=projective_x_limb0`, `dp_bits`,
  `dp_count`, and `dp_checksum`.
- Local M3 autoresearch result with `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - median `35,573,689.248061 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - min `29,957,098.382191 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - max `36,883,132.894670 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Precomputed Metal DP Mask

Commit: `99ea964` (`perf: precompute Metal DP mask`)

- Moved the projective distinguished-point mask calculation out of the
  `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table` kernel and into the host dispatch path.
- Buffer 10 now carries a precomputed `uint64_t`/Metal `ulong` mask instead of
  `dp_bits`, preserving the `dp_bits=0` semantics where every finite point is a
  candidate while removing a branch and shift from every GPU thread.
- The CPU oracle uses the same `ProjectiveDpMask` helper, so GPU output and
  verification remain locked to the same predicate.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk_dp`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - candidate median `36,056,697.229186 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `33,537,315.709809 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.075122x`
  - candidate min `27,685,884.633058 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - candidate max `38,595,363.397466 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

### Precomputed Metal Jump Index Base

Commit: `2ba6704` (`perf: precompute Metal jump index base`)

- Moved `id * steps` out of the `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table` loop and
  reused `jump_base + step` for each jump-index load.
- The source gate now rejects reintroducing the per-step `id * steps + step`
  address calculation while also preserving the no-hot-modulo and precomputed
  DP-mask checks.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk_dp`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - candidate median `36,123,063.713799 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `29,592,623.352879 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.220678x`
  - candidate min `23,157,880.850366 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - candidate max `46,746,041.618214 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`
  - Note: this run was noisy, but the paired median still cleared the configured
    keep gate.

### Reused Metal Output Base

Commit: `048c827` (`perf: reuse Metal output base`)

- Reused `p_base` as `out_base` inside `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table` because
  the packed input and output Jacobian layouts use the same 12-limb stride.
- The Metal source gate now rejects a second `id * 12` calculation in the jump
  walk kernel while keeping the previous jump-index and DP-mask hot-path guards.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk_dp`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - candidate median `32,951,131.617042 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `29,806,708.480270 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.105494x`
  - candidate min `23,577,104.868518 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - candidate max `39,231,627.754174 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`
  - Note: measured throughput is still noisy on the local MacBook Air, but this
    candidate cleared the paired keep gate and preserved every oracle field.

### Shifted Metal Q-Table Base

Commit: `dc2d1dd` (`perf: use shift for Metal q base`)

- Changed the affine jump-table base calculation from `jump_index * 8` to
  `jump_index << 3` inside `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table`.
- This is mathematically identical for the packed affine table stride, but the
  source gate now makes the intended power-of-two addressing explicit.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk_dp`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - candidate median `26,896,574.393133 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `20,301,093.835039 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.324883x`
  - candidate min `23,151,973.252512 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - candidate max `27,558,986.411632 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`
  - Note: absolute throughput was lower than some earlier local runs, but the
    paired median kept the candidate and all oracle fields matched.

### Specialized Metal Steps8 Jump-Walk Kernel

Commit: `7acdc28` (`perf: add Metal steps8 jump-walk kernel`)

- Added `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table_steps8`, selected only when
  `steps_per_sample == 8`. Other step counts keep using the generic
  `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table` kernel.
- The specialized kernel preserves the same buffer layout and oracle fields,
  but uses a fixed 8-step hot loop and `id << 3` for the jump-index base.
- The Metal source gate now requires both the generic fallback and the
  specialized fixed-step path, including distance accumulation and projective
  DP flag checks.
- Paired M3 autoresearch against `main` for
  `metal_jacobian_jump_walk_dp`, `steps_per_sample=8`, `jump_count=16`,
  and `dp_bits=4`:
  - candidate median `38,243,083.846592 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired baseline median `34,828,506.038031 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - paired speedup `1.098040x`
  - candidate min `36,303,991.961639 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - candidate max `42,489,642.760573 mixed-add steps/sec`
  - `distance_checksum=0xa45f471493cace2f`
  - `dp_count=1000`
  - `dp_checksum=0x30a7914972cba014`
  - `status=keep`
  - `correctness=true`
  - `threadgroup_limit=256`
  - `threads_per_threadgroup=256`

## Rejected Or Non-Merged Experiments

These did not pass the performance gate or had a correctness/architecture issue:

- `macos-affine-prefix-split-tame`: speedup `0.995234`; discarded.
- `macos-dp-combined-record`: speedup `0.987156`; discarded.
- `macos-affine-jump-index-reuse`: incorrect behavior for the gate shape
  (`avg_dp_count` changed from `288` to `1172`); discarded.
- `macos-field-self-ops-v2`: speedup `0.993284`; discarded.
- `macos-native-cpu-flags-v3`: speedup `1.001949`, below gate; discarded.
- `macos-metal-square-generic`: correct but slower/unstable; not merged.
- `macos-metal-tg512`: correct and sometimes faster for
  `field_mul_mod_p`, but rejected because `field_square_mod_p` regressed badly
  in direct Metal runs. Keep the current 256-thread cap as the baseline until a
  broader Metal benchmark shows a consistent cross-kernel win.
- `--tg-limit N` is now available on Metal field benchmark commands for
  reproducible sweeps. The default remains 256 unless an experiment proves a
  better cross-kernel cap.
- A direct sweep with `--tg-limit` found `384` promising for some `mul` and
  `square` runs, but a repeat square comparison flipped back in favor of 256.
  Treat 384 as inconclusive, not as a new baseline.
- Metal field autoresearch experiments use three runner samples so keep/discard
  decisions are based on median throughput instead of a single noisy GPU run.
- `macos-metal-jacobian-tg512`: a single direct run suggested a possible win
  for the point-level `jacobian_add_affine` kernel, but paired autoresearch
  rejected it. Candidate tg512 median was `15,788,868.363001 ops/sec` versus
  baseline tg256 `23,401,670.068526 ops/sec`, `paired_speedup=0.674690`,
  `status=discard`, `correctness=true`. Keep Jacobian add at the current
  256-thread default until a broader retest shows a stable win.
- `macos-metal-q-limb-preload`: explicitly preloading the 8 affine jump-table
  limbs before `jacobian_add_affine_values` preserved all oracle fields but
  failed the paired gate. Candidate median was `32,121,834.312940 ops/sec`
  versus baseline `42,950,885.665018 ops/sec`, `paired_speedup=0.747874`,
  `status=discard`, `correctness=true`. Avoid this shape unless a future
  register-pressure or occupancy change alters the tradeoff.
- `macos-metal-steps8-unroll`: explicitly unrolling all eight fixed steps in
  `jacobian_affine_walk_jump_table_steps8` preserved all oracle fields but
  failed the paired gate. Candidate median was `27,823,058.415239 ops/sec`
  versus baseline `36,861,665.504647 ops/sec`, `paired_speedup=0.754797`,
  `status=discard`, `correctness=true`. Keep the compact fixed-loop kernel;
  avoid manual unroll unless later register-pressure data changes the tradeoff.

## Next Research Targets

- Move from isolated field kernels toward Jacobian point kernels on Metal.
- Keep CPU tiny-range kangaroo as the correctness oracle while GPU kernels are
  introduced one layer at a time.
- Prefer fused kernels only when paired benchmarks show a real win. The fused
  operation must still expose an oracle and a reproducible benchmark.
- Explore Metal memory layout for point batches before attempting full
  distinguished-point table work on GPU.
- Keep multi-target CPU architecture unchanged unless a candidate beats the
  paired autoresearch gate and preserves full collision verification.

## Cleanup Policy

- After a feature is merged to `main` and pushed, remove only its clean accepted
  worktree and delete only its merged local branch.
- Do not remove dirty or rejected worktrees until their useful findings have
  been recorded and any wanted diff has been intentionally saved.
- Keep README files focused on user-facing commands. Keep detailed experiment
  history here and raw metrics in `autoresearch/results.tsv` plus
  `autoresearch/benchmarks.jsonl`.
